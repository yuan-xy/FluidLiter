FluidLiter is a lighter version of FluidLite and is not compatible with FluidLite.

FluidLite (c) 2016 Robin Lobel is a very light version of FluidSynth
designed to be hardware, platform and external dependency independent.
It only uses standard C libraries.

FluidLite keeps very minimal functionalities (only synth),
therefore MIDI file reading, realtime MIDI events and audio output must be
implemented externally.

## Quick Start
TODO.
